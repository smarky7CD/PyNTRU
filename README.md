# PyNTRU

This is my version of NTRUEncrypt written in Python 3. It is currently for research purposes only. I strongly recommend (perhaps demand) that this implementation is not used for sensitive data. It has not been vetted and is probably insecure.


## Install

```bash

git clone https://github.com/smarky7CD/PyNTRU.git

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

```

## Using

As this is purely for research, there is not much of a higher level API exposed. Although the ```ntru_key_object.py``` would be the place to go for those interested. Also, check out the ```keys``` directory.
